# Rules in naming variables
''' A variable can have a short name like x and y or a more discriptivej name like age, base and all.
A variable must start with a letter or an underscore character
A variable can not start with a digit 
Variable names are case sensitive like Age and age are two differerent things
A variable cannot have spaces
A variable name cannot be any go key

NOTE A Variable names with more than one word cab be difficult to read therefore we use these examples
1. camel case 
each word, exept the first, starts with a capital letter
e.g  myVariableName = John
2. Pascal case
Each word starts with a capital letter
eg MyVariableName = John
3. snake case 
each word is seperated by an underscore character
eg Ubochi_Chibuike_Daniels'''
